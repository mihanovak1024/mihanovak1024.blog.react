# Motivation
I've decided to pursue a career of a FullStack developer. I've started with Frontend through [roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and [roadmap.sh/react](https://roadmap.sh/react) resources.

I've learned the basics through theory first and this is my first attempt to use the learned theory in practice. 

# Stack
I'll try to use React with JSX, but without any advanced tools like Redux, UI Frameworks (Boostrap/Tailwind/ChakraUI) and without a backend (NextJS/Gatsby) or any API fetching (Apollo). This will be a static page with hardcoded content.

I might create a branch where I'll also include some UI Frameworks and Redux. Still no backend tho'. It will be included in a different project.

# Disclaimer
I'm just getting in to the world of React and I expect the code to have some bugs, poor architectural structuring, ..., but I'll try my best to write with DRY principle in mind.

# Reviewing
Any reviewer that finds code blocks that can be improved, I urge you to open a pull request, because I'd really like to know what I could've done better.
